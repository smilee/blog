What is product success? If product strategy were anything like military tactics, a product would not lose a customer if it knew the customer and the product itself, <!-- more -->as adage from "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu suggests.

Economic principles reveal that people will trade money for what they believe is worth the cost. In other words, a successful product provides value desirable to customers. So how does one go about delivering this value?

The competitive edge of a company sets it apart from others. While undoubtedly significant for the company's survival, many fall in the trap of thinking that refining this edge is the only key to product success.

Keep in mind that customer needs, not the product team's strengths, ultimately define product value. For example, let's imagine that you need a quick way to organize and store brushes of different sizes on the go while maximizing the brush lifespan. There are two solutions on the market: product A guarantees a ten year lifespan for the brushes but burdens the user at five kilograms while product B offers a nine year lifespan with a compact design at five-hundred grams. Which product would you buy?
